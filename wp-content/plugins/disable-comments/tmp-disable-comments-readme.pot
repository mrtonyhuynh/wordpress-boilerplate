msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "By default, the plugin does not make any persistent changes to your posts - it just dynamically closes comments on them. This means that you can use the plugin temporarily and restore comment statuses when you disable it. If the plugin works in this mode, then I recommend that you don't use persistent mode."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Unfortunately some themes do not properly check the comment status of posts, and the plugin in default mode will have no effect with them (comments will still appear to be open). To fix this, switch to persistent mode. Note however that this will make persistent changes: <strong>comments will remain closed even if you later disable the plugin</strong> (you can always reopen them manually, of course)."

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "If you still see the message, then it means your theme is overriding this behaviour, and you will have to edit its files manually to remove it. Two common approaches are to either delete or comment out the relevant lines in <code>wp-content/your-theme/comments.php</code>, or to add a declaration to <code>wp-content/your-theme/style.css</code> that hides the message from your visitors. In either case, make you you know what you are doing!"
